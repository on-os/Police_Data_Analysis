# Police Data Analysis
This project analyzes a police dataset to uncover insights about driver demographics and arrest rates. The analysis is conducted using Python, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The Google Colab environment was used to run the code. The dataset was obtained from [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivekverma97/police-csv-file-pandas-basic/data).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about police stops, including driver age, arrest status, and other relevant details.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handling missing values and data type conversions.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Descriptive statistics and visualizations of driver age distribution.
3. **Arrest Analysis**:
   - Visualization of arrest counts versus non-arrest counts by age.

## Insights
- Younger drivers (ages 20-30) are more frequently on the road compared to older people.
- Despite the lower number of older drivers, they have a higher proportion of arrests compared to younger drivers, as evident from the graph.

## Visualization files
- Distribution of Drivers' Age
- Count of Arrests vs Non-Arrests by Age

## Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into how driver age relates to arrest rates, which can inform policy decisions and targeted interventions for traffic safety.
